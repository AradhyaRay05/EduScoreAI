# EduScoreAI - AI-powered student grade prediction

## Project Goal
EduScoreAI is designed to predict student performance by analyzing exam scores and demographic details. It provides a predicted grade, helping teachers and institutions identify performance patterns and assist students who may be at risk.

---

## Overview
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify student grades based on input features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and exam scores.  
The model was trained on a student performance dataset, evaluated using standard metrics, and deployed as a **Streamlit web app** for interactive use.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed null values and standardized the dataset.
- Encoded categorical features:
  - Gender  
  - Race/Ethnicity  
  - Parental Level of Education  
  - Lunch  
  - Test Preparation Course  
- Added engineered features such as:
  - **Pass/Fail per subject (Math, Reading, Writing)**  
  - **Total Score**  
  - **Percentage**  
  - **Overall Pass/Fail status**  
- Scaled features using **StandardScaler**.

### 2. Model Building
- Chose **Logistic Regression** due to its simplicity and interpretability.  
- Trained the model on the processed dataset.  
- Achieved strong generalization without overfitting.  
- Saved the trained model (`model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`) for deployment.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- Evaluated on test data with the following results:  
  - **Accuracy Score:** 0.82 (82%)  
  - **Precision:** 0.81  
  - **Recall:** 0.80  
  - **F1-Score:** 0.80  
- Confusion matrix shows reliable performance across multiple grade categories.

### 4. Deployment
- Built a **Streamlit web app** (`app.py`) for easy user interaction.  
- Integrated the trained logistic regression model and scaler.  
- Users can input details (demographics, scores) and get instant grade predictions.  
- Features of the deployed app:
  - Clean input interface with dropdowns and sliders.  
  - Automated feature encoding and scaling.  
  - Real-time prediction with grades (O, A, B, C, D, E).  
- Ready for hosting on **Streamlit Cloud / Heroku / Render**.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy** (mathematical operations)
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, scaling, evaluation)
- **Streamlit** (deployment & UI)

## Features
- Predicts student grades (O, A, B, C, D, E).
- Uses demographic, parental, and exam score data.
- Pass/Fail detection for each subject.
- Calculates total score, percentage, and overall status.
- Interactive Streamlit UI for predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Deploy on cloud (Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Heroku).
- Add support for multiple models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
- Expand dataset for broader applicability.
- Integrate performance insights dashboards.
- Enable CSV bulk upload for multiple student predictions.
